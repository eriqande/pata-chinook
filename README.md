# pata-chinook

A small repository with work that I am doing to test whether the somewhat
"off-label" use of GSI for identifying the origin of introduced populations
gives reasonable results when using our big chinook SNP baseline.  This is
in support of a project that Javier Ciancio is doing on the invasion of
Patagonian rivers by Chinook salmon.
